# snp-prototype-mongodb-client

A basic MongoDB instance that is used as a client and is bootstrapped with some scripts that can be viewed or executed.  

This is used to support the [Semantic Normalization Prototype](https://github.com/jlgrock/snp-prototype).  Documentation on how to use this can also be found there.
